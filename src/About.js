      <h2>Tarin McCarthy</h2>
      I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) dedicated to empowering individuals on their journey to emotional well-being. With a compassionate and empathetic approach, I create a safe and non-judgmental space for clients to explore their thoughts and feelings.  
      I specialize in helping clients navigate issues related to anxiety, depression, stress management, and relationship difficulties. I believe in solution focused therapy with a client centered approach to help you achieve your goals and move forward with living your best life.  
      By integrating evidence-based practices, mindfulness techniques, and a strengths-based perspective, I can assist in building resilience, enhancing self-awareness, and fostering meaningful connections in your life.
